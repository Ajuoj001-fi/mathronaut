Although the App does not collect personal data, we aim to ensure that any game score data stored locally remains secure on the user’s device and is not accessible to other applications or third parties.

9. Ads and Third-Party Data Collection

The App displays ads provided by a third-party advertising partner, such as [e.g., Google AdMob]. These advertising partners may collect data from the user’s device and app usage to deliver personalized ads.

The collected data may include:

-Device identifiers
-Location information (if the user has granted permission)
-Other technical data related to the device and app usage
The collection and use of this data are governed by the advertising partner's own privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage users to review the e.g., Google AdMob Privacy Policy for more information about the data practices of our advertising partners.

Users have the option to manage ad targeting through their device settings or by contacting the advertising partners directly.
